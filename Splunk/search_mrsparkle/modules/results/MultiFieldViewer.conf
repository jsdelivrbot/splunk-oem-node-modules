description = This module is typically for use within the sidebar, and shows a set of field names, with distinct counts next to them in parentheses. When the user clicks on the field names, a popup layer will open showing the top 10 values for that field.   Clicking then on one of those values will add the proper field=value term and re run the search.

[param:field]
required= False
label = This field was a parameter on the parent class, but is not required for this class.


[param:link]
required= False
label = If this option is present, a link will be presented. This is used for things like 'see top values over time'  in the individual layers.

[param:maxDisplayLength]
required = False
label = Indicates the maximum number of characters of the field name to show in the main view.  Excess characters will be stripped from the middle of the string.  The tooltip on the field name will display the full field name value.

description = Creates a selction list from a set of options.  Options can either be configured manually or by defining an entity endpoint from which to generate its options.

[param:name]
required = True
label = The name of the html select element generated.

[param:mode]
required = False
default = static
label = This is the mode in which the Select should work.  "static" implies that it will only use the list of options provided to it to render this list.  "list" designates the use of a listing endpoint to generate the option elements.
values = static,list

[param:options]
required = False
label = This is the list of options that Splunk displays in the dropdown selector. When in 'list' mode, Splunk displays the options defined here first and then displays options received from the listEndpoint beneath them.  Each option includes a text key which is the text of the option, a value key which is the value of the option and an optional selected key which, when set to True sets the current option to selected.  Selected should NOT be set manually when mode=list unless no selected option has been defined for the list.

[param:label]
require = False
label = The test to appear to the left of the selector form element.
translate = string

# List mode params

[param:listEndpoint]
required = False
label = This is required if mode=list. Relatively defined list endpoint to communicate with in order to generate the options list.  For example if you want a list of all the local applications set listEndpoint to "entities/apps/local".

[param:text]
required = False
label = This is the name of the field in the list endpoint's results that should be used to generate the text of the option elements.  It is required in list mode. For example, if the list returns a field called name, setting text = name means that the name field will be used to generate the visible text of the option.

[param:value]
required = False
label = The name of the field from the list endpoint's results that should be used to set the value of an option element. It is required in list mode.

[param:selected]
required = False
label = If the selected value is present in the option results, this sets that option to selected.  This is optional in list mode.  Note, setting selected manually in the options param may conflict with this setting.

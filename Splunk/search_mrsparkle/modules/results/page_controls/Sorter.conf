description = Sorter displays a list of fields that can be sorted upon.  Given a list of field names, Sorter will create a set of delimited links which the user can click on.  Clicking on these links will pass a "sort" setting down to Sorter's child modules which can iterpret how to preform the sort on their own.

[param:fields]
required = False
label = This is a list of comma delimited field labels which are displayed.  If the optional param field_values isn't provided, clicking a field label passes the field label as the field value.  Order is preserved in the field label list display.
translate = *:label

[param:sortKey]
required = False
# sticky = True
# persistable = True
label = If this is provided, it initiates the Sorter with the defined label.  When undefined, this defaults internally to the first field name defined in the view config.

[param:sortDir]
required = False
default = asc
values = asc, desc
# sticky = True
# persistable = True
label = This provides the direction to push a sort when a Sorter module is initiated.

[param:delimiter]
required = False
default = |
label = The delimiter used to seperate each displayed field label.

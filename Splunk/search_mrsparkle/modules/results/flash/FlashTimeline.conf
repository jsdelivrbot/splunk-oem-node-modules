description = This module contains a JavaScript object that is capable of displaying a chart of number of events over time. This chart will be updated asynchronously while the search is running.

[param:swfFile]
required = False
label =  This is the path, relative to $SPLUNK_HOME/share/splunk/search_mrsparkle/exposed/flash, that specifies the swf to load. The swf must conform to a very strict and thus-far undocumented spec that is not for external consumption. 
Default = timeline.swf

[param:width]
required = True
label = This specifies the width of the module. It can be a percentage or a number of pixels. Typically this is set to "100%" meaning it should fill all available space.  It can also be set to a number of pixels by using a value like "500px".

[param:height]
required = True
label = This specifies the height of the module. It can be a percentage or a number of pixels.
sticky = true
persistable = true

[param:enableResize]
required = False
label = Control whether the module displays the vertical resize handle.
values = True,False
default = True

[param:statusBuckets]
required = False
default = 300
label = This is the maximum number of time buckets that the backend is can persist while it runs the search. When present, it overrides the default of 300. Values lower than 300 will result in slightly faster search times, but displays less information to the user.

[param:maxBucketCount]
required = False
default = 1000
label = Specifies the maximum number of buckets to render.  This is mostly a failsafe mechanism to prevent the browser from crashing if the server returns an excessive number of buckets.

[param:minimized]
required = False
default = False
label = when set to True, the timeline will be in a collapsed or minimized state.  The user is free to open it or minimize it at any point, and any change they make will be remembered when they return to the given view.
values = True,False
sticky = true
persistable = true

[param:renderer]
required = False
values = auto,canvas,flash
default = auto
label = Specifies the renderer to use for the timeline.  When set to auto, the module will use canvas if available, otherwise it will use flash.

[param:minimalMode]
required = False
values = True,False
default = False
label = When set to True, the timeline axes will be collapsed, the height of the module will be reduced to minimalHeight, and the resize handle will be disabled.

[param:minimalHeight]
required = False
default = 55px
label = The height of the module when minimalMode is True.

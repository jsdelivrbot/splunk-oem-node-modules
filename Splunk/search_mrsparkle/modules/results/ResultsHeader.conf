superClass = Splunk.Module.SimpleResultsHeader

description = This module displays a header like '23,420 events' and is for placement generally above a FlashTimeline or above a set of modules implementing paging controls


[param:prefix]
required = False
label = When this option is present, the value of this key will be displayed before the number displayed.  For example you can set it to 'Found', for the overall display to come out as 'Found 23,420 events'
translate = string


[param:entityLabel]
required = True
label = This specifies what should appear after the displayed number.  Typically this will be a value like 'events', or 'results', but for very narrowly defined views it could be 'pages edited'.
translate = string

[param:entityLabelSingular]
required = False
label = This is the singular form of the 'entityLabel' parameter.  It is displayed when there is 1 result row returned from the search.
translate = string

[param:entityName]
required = True
label = This specifies how the module should get the number that it displays.
values = events,results,scanned,auto

[param:link]
required = False
label = This is a dictionary of config values specifying behaviour for a link that the module can display. This link sends the user to a different view where this search result is displayed instead. It contains a 'label' key that is the link text, and a 'viewTarget' key that is the search result view to which the user should be sent, and a 'popup' key that, when set to True, makes the link open the search result view in a new popup window.

[param:headerFormat]
required = False
label = This is used by SimpleResultsHeader but it is not used here where we have different containers and possibly different styles for the count, the 'label' and the time header.

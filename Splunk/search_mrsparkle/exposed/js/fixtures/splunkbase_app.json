  "description": "The Splunk App for Windows Infrastructure provides examples of pre-built data inputs, searches, reports, and dashboards for Windows server and desktop management. You can monitor, manage, and troubleshoot Windows operating systems, including Active Directory elements, all from one place. \n\nIncluded are inputs for performance metrics, event logs, user and audit data. The app makes getting started with Splunk a breeze.  The App also contains dashboards needed to monitor your Active Directory environment and allows for correlation opportunities from the Active Directory data back to the Operating System.  \n\nA unique first-time run experience detects data you might already have to highlight areas for your specific environment. Host Monitoring, Print Monitoring, and Network Monitoring also light up new possibilities.",

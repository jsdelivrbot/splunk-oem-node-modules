Getting Started
===============

Installation
------------

### Use Splunk's internal npm repository

1. Create an `.npmrc` file in the root of your project (if you don't already have one)
1. Add a registry entry:
    ```
    registry=https://repo.splunk.com/artifactory/api/npm/npm
    ```

### Intall Splunk UI and dependencies
1. Splunk UI has two peer dependencies, react and react-dom:
    ```
    npm install react react-dom
    ```
1. Install the main package:
    ```
    npm install splunk-ui
    ```

### View the Splunk UI Docs app
Splunk UI includes a documentation app with many examples and code snippets. To view it, you will need a simple http server. If you don't already have one installed, it is easy to get one:
```
npm install -g static-server
```

Move to the docs/build directory:
```
cd docs/build
```

Start the server on the docs app:
```
static-server -p 8012 -n index.html
```

Production
----------
To use Splunk UI and React in production mode, set the environment variable `NODE_ENV` to `"production"`. This will remove developer warnings and guidance from the output code. If using webpack, see the [DefinePlugin](https://webpack.github.io/docs/list-of-plugins.html#defineplugin) for details on how to set this up.

API Status Indicators
---------

Throughout the documentation you will see "API Status" indicators. These will give you an idea of how well established a given API is and how likely or dramatically it will be changed in the future. There are five status levels:

* **Deprecated**: This API is known to be problematic, and changes are planned. Do not rely on it. Use of the feature may cause warnings. Backwards compatibility should not be expected.

* **Alpha**: This API is new and not well established. It may dramatically in a future version or be removed altogether.

* **Beta**: This API has been used and is beginning to solidify. It may change in a future version, but is on track to stable status.

* **Stable**: This API has proven satisfactory and will not be broken unless there is a very strong reason to do so.

* **Locked**: Only fixes related to security, performance, or bug fixes will be considered for APIs that are locked.

Working with Backbone
---------------------

Splunk has a lot of code written in Backbone. Fortunately, Backbone and React play pretty well together! See [Working with Backbone](./Backbone) for some tips and suggestions on using Backbone alongside React.

Working with components
-----------------------

### Children

Almost all components accept children of type node.
The children prop is only included in the documentation where there are additional constraints.

### Styling components
The User Experience and UI Framework teams expects all apps to conform to standard styles.
This library will be updated to reflect any updates to our visual design standards.
Components do not, and will not, support theming or other changes to their appearance.

Pass style to control layout, margins or positioning, such as:

    <Button label="Hello" style={{ flexBasis: '200px' }} />

Many components have an inline property to switch between
inline-block/inline-flex and block/flex.
Use this property instead of passing a style prop.

    <Button inline={false} />

Passing className as a prop is not supported. Doing so will add the className, but this is
reserved for internal usage within the library.

### Fonts

Splunk UI does not include fonts. You must define and load them in a @font-face declaration.
When used on a page with Splunk Enterprise's global stylesheets "Roboto" will be applied to the
Components. The default font, "Splunk Platform Sans" is not currently defined, but could be aliased
to a new font in the future.

Splunk Enterprise fonts:

    Sans (Default): "Splunk Platform Sans", "Roboto", "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica,
        Arial, sans-serif;
    Mono: "Splunk Platform Mono", 'Droid Sans Mono', 'Consolas', 'Monaco',
        'Courier New', Courier, monospace;

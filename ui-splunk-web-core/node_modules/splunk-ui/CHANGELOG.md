-----------

API Changes:
* Icons underwent a large refactor, including:
    * Icons have been separated into their own files and moved to their own directory.
        * Before: `import { Code } from 'splunk-ui/components/Icon'`
        * Now: `import Code from 'splunk-ui/icons/Code';`
        * This improves consumers bundle size. They only get the icon files they use.
    * The `square` prop was removed, and `height` and `width` props added.
    * The `size` prop now supports a string for setting a value with unit.
    * The `ornamental` prop was removed from Icon. `screenReaderText` can be set to `null` or
      empty string instead.
* `Collapsible` was replaced with `TransitionOpen`, which supports a variety of animation types.
* The API for `Modal` and `Modal.Header` were updated to conform to our standard API used elsewhere.
    * The `onClose` callback was replaced with `onRequestClose`, which is now passed a reason and an
    event.
    * The `enableClickAway` and `enableEscClose` props were removed. Use the reason provided by the
    `onRequestClose` callback instead.
* In the `Date` component, the `defaultDate` prop has been replaced with `defaultValue` to be more
consistent with the API of other components. See also, the new controlled mode below.
* In the `Text` component, the `rows` prop has been renamed to `rowsMin`.
* The `Calendar` component has been removed.

Overview:
This release contains a major refactor of how state is managed by our components. Many components now support both the controlled and uncontrolled patterns. In general, to use the controlled pattern, set the `propName` and to use the uncontrolled pattern set the `defaultPropName`. See [React Forms Documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html) for more details on these patterns and the detailed notes below for impacts on Splunk UI. We also standardized the api for components that open and close with `onRequestOpen` and `onRequestClose` callbacks.

API Changes:
* `Dropdown` now supports both the controlled and uncontrolled patterns for open. To use the controlled pattern, use the `open` prop and to use the uncontrolled use `defaultOpen`.
* `Accordion`:
    * Now only supports a single panel. Use `CollapsiblePanel` when `Accordion` does not provide the necessary functionality.
    * `Accordion.Section` was renamed to `Accordion.Panel`.
    * `active` prop was replaced with the `openPanelId` prop.
    * Now supports both the controlled and uncontrolled patterns for the `openPanelId` prop.
* `RadioBar`:
    * Renamed `Radio` to `RadioBar`.
    * Renamed `Radio.Button` to `RadioBar.Option`.
    * Now supports both the controlled and uncontrolled patterns for the `value` prop.
* `RadioList`:
    * Renamed `RadioList.Item` to `RadioList.Option`.
    * Now supports both the controlled and uncontrolled patterns for the `value` prop.
* `Select`:
    * Renamed `Select.Item` to `Select.Option`.
    * Now supports both the controlled and uncontrolled patterns for the `value` prop.
* `Text` now supports both the controlled and uncontrolled patterns for the `value` prop.
* `Tooltip` now provides the `onRequestOpen` and `onRequestClose` props for use in controlling the `open` prop. The uncontrolled pattern is still supported, but there is no `defaultOpen` prop.

New Features:
* Sortable column headers in `Table`.
* Expandable rows in `Table`.
* New `StaticContent` component for showing well formatted static content in a `ControlGroup`.
* `Button` and `Link` now have a `focus` method.
* Splunk configuration data is now available through the `splunk-ui/util/splunkConfig` module.
* New `CollapsiblePanel` component. This was a subcomponent of `Accordion`, but was moved to its own component to provide greater flexibility.

Bug Fixes:
* Removed hover styles from `Accordion` Head.
* `Dropdown`s no longer scroll the page and close on Safari.
* The clear button now works for `Text`s with the `search` appearance.

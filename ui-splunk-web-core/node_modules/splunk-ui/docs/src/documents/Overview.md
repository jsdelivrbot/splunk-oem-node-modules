Overview
========

A library for building Splunk user interfaces.

Principles
----------
### Encapsulated
No globals whatsoever.

This means the code will not conflict with other code on the page
and can be run in conjunction with our current libraries and in
places that they cannot.

### Modular
Use what you need, and get only what you need.

Developers should control their dependencies, select what they
want, and upgrade when they want.

### Composable
A composable architecture so that if a core component doesn't fit
perfectly, the developer can easily compose the necessary pieces
to build the perfect component.

### Documented
Make it easy for developers to find whats available and how to
use it.

### Easy to Use
A set of core components that just work out of the box.

### Accessible
More than just meeting 508 compliance, components will follow best
practices in accessibility, such as aria attributes.

### Versioned
APIs for components have been reviewed, vetted and normalized for
public consumption. Communicate changes to APIs and new features.

### Modern
Use the latest standards, best practices, and best open source libraries for UI code.

### Secure
Build security directly into the framework.
